2. Did you add any "extra" features?
Instead of vega-lite visuals, we created a US Map to show how many people worked for the companies in that state out of our collected reviews and the mean rating for each of those companies. We switched to the US Map visual to make it more interactive for our users. Users can click on a state and see information/fun fact about that state or about the job ratings.
