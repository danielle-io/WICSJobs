This meant I reported to the Operations Manager, and we didn't have basic SWE infrastructure (I built a lot of it myself). It was, however, really good for my growth in terms of business and meetings, so my communication skills improved a lot. I also worked with some pretty amazing people, and the technical advisor is one of my favorite people in the world. He's just on the board (so doesn't work for the company), but I've had several fruitful conversations with him. I also had a lot of space to work and think about projects end-to-end, so it was a lot of \"power\" for an intern looking for experience. Pay was quite awful, but like I mentioned, I was in it for the experience so it made it better.",

I really enjoyed working with other interns and most of the work I did for the project was not very technical. By the end of our internship, the company flew the Bay Area interns out to Nashville where the HQ is to present out business case to the CTO.\n\nAside from the business case, my intern project covered many topics and I was able to sample different roles and projects such as iOS and Android mobile development, Machine Learning/Data Science, and IoT. My team operated like a small startup, which I also found as a valuable experience. It was a fantastic first internship experience in that I got to try many different technologies, and I also had my first real code reviews where I learned a lot from one of the senior engineers on my team.",

The first two weeks were onboarding, understanding what the team I joined worked on and some intern events, but after those two weeks it felt like my onboarding for the team continued a little longer than anticipated. It felt like it wasn't until the middle of the internship that I was put on a project and the project I was on was on a deadline so I felt like I only really coded for about 3, possibly 4 weeks out of 12. This was fine, I just expected that I would have more to work on so I could learn more. Overall though, the internship experience was nice. It was great that I was able to be surrounded by the other interns and they had several events for all of us to learn about what each other was doing.",
